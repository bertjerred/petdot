# Pet Dot
Pet Dot is your very own virtual pet, and it just happens to be a dot.
The dot scurries around the screen - though never very far!
The dot needs no Internet, just a browser.

## Pet Dots Want to Eat Characters
Every so often, Pet Dot will ask you to feed it something that you can type on your keyboard.
What you feed it affects its mood.
When it's hungry, a beep will sound.

## Naming, saving, and loading pets
If you name and save a pet, a `.pet` file is created.
It's really just a `text file` that you can open with a simple text editor.
Inside, you'll see that various things are logged, like time and mood.
To load a pet you interacted with before, just load the .pet file and pick up where you left off.
